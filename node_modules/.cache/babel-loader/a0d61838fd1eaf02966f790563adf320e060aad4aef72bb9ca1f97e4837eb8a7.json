I'm Sofia Hansen, and my journey into perfumery began as a way to find solace during my late husband's battle with brain cancer. In early 2024, I discovered Middle Eastern perfumes—their rich scents, beautiful bottles, and affordability captivated me. I immersed myself in the craft, taking online courses, listening to podcasts, and reading books on fragrance blending. I experimented with materials, creating my first gourmand scent—marshmallow—and fell in love with the art and science behind perfumery.\",\n  storyParagraph2: \"To deepen my knowledge, I traveled to Dubai to learn from master perfumers, an incredible experience that refined my skills. Understanding fragrance composition, longevity, and adherence to International Fragrance Association (IFRA) regulations became essential in crafting high-quality, long-lasting scents.
